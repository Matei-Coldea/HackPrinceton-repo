# Optional Quantum Computing Dependencies
# These are optional - the system will fall back to classical algorithms if not installed
# 
# WARNING: qiskit has compatibility issues with Python 3.12+
# If you encounter build errors, you can skip these dependencies
# The obligations_quantum.py service will automatically use classical greedy algorithm

# For Python 3.11 and below:
qiskit==0.45.0
qiskit-optimization==0.6.0

# If you're on Python 3.12+, try these newer versions (experimental):
# qiskit>=1.0.0
# qiskit-optimization>=0.6.1
